# 4 questions in this assignment.

# Note: When guessing output, try not to print before guessing
# This will help you understand the logic behind the code

# Question 1
"""
Guess the output for the following program
"""

common_passwords = ["123456", "qwerty", "forgot"]
password = "password"
if password in common_passwords:
    print password, "in the list"
else:
    print password, "not in the list"
    
'''
 Now substitute "password" in password with a raw_input statement.
 User tests three types of input:
    1) "qwerty"
    2) "letmein"
    3) Hit Enter key (Do not enter anything ie.- string length = 0)
Think of cases 2 and 3, write an if-else loop inside the else loop above.
(Hint: Use len(string) to handle the cases.)
Handle input a) if length of input is 6 char long b) if it's not 6 char long
Print appropriate message and also handle the case where
The code should be able to print a statement for any of the three cases
above.

# Once you have a working code, test your new code in the following function
# Remember to comment out input statement
# Follow indentation 4- spaces when pasting if-else loop here.

Goal: Create a second list that looks like this: [snapple, snout, snore, snail, snare]
1) Add "are" to the first_list
2) Write a for loop that iterates over the first list
3) Create a new word that matches the condition seen in the second list
4) Now add new word to this list
5) Print a list that looks like the Goal above

Use the code logic given above
1) Print Number of turns remaining in the same line as you entered, word
2) new_string is another variable that forms a strings out of words we enter
2a) After the print statement, write code that adds our input word to this string
eg. if I enter words "Betty", "is", "a", "great", "singer" one at a time as input,
new string should look like this after every turn: a) Betty b) Betty is c) Betty is a
d) Betty is a great e) Betty is a great singer
